In [the previous post](https://open-ebike.github.io/devlog/2025/09/10/the-implications-of-eu-data-act.html) we learned how the EU Data Act aims to establish harmonized rules on fair access to and use of data.
Three of its most important roles are

* **user** being defined as "a natural or legal person that owns a connected product or to whom temporary rights to use that connected product have been contractually transferred, or that receives related services"
* **data holder** - being defined as "any natural or legal person with the right or obligation to use and make data available"
* **data recipient** - being defined as "a natural or legal person, acting for purposes which are related to that personâ€™s trade, business, craft or profession, other than the user of a connected product or related service, to whom the data holder makes data available..."

It is crucial to understand that not only third parties but also the user themselves has the right to access their own data generated by a connected product.
This dev log documents a sample project in which we take two roles: the user of a Bosch-powered eBike and the data recipient accessing the data generated by the eBike.  
Step-by-step we will explore

- how to generate data using a Bosch-powered eBike
- [how to register for data access](https://open-ebike.github.io/devlog/2025/09/12/register-for-data-access.html)
- [how to grant access to data](https://open-ebike.github.io/devlog/2025/09/13/grant-access-to-data.html)
- [how retrieve data via REST calls](https://open-ebike.github.io/devlog/2025/09/14/retrieve-data-via-rest-calls)

Later on we will

- implement a simple web app that displays the user data
- implement a simple use case based on the data

# Step 1: Generate data using a Bosch-powered eBike

In order to make use of our own data we need

- a SingleKey ID account
- the Bosch Flow app (which I will use on an Android device)
- and of course a Bosch powered eBike

## Create a SingleKey ID account

[SingleKey ID](https://singlekey-id.com/) is an identify provider that can be used for apps and services of multiple brands such as Bosch and Siemens Home Appliances.

To create an account you can

- either register at https://singlekey-id.com/en-us/login
- or register during the onboarding of the Flow app

## Install the Flow app

To create meaningful data while riding a Bosch eBike you need to install the [eBike Flow app](https://www.bosch-ebike.com/de/produkte/ebike-flow-app) which is available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bosch.ebike.onebikeapp&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ebike-flow/id1559900907).

After installing the app on your mobile device create a SingleKey ID account (if you haven't done so in the previous step) and log in using your credentials.

## Ride a Bosch eBike

Both available [Bosch eBike generations](https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/overview) - the Bosch **eBike system 2** and the more recent **smart system** - facilitate data access based on EU Data Act. For this showcase I will be using an eBike powered by the Bosch Smart System.
We need to track at least one activity using the Flow app to generate some data that can be accessed via the EU Data Act interface.
