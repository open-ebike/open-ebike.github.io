In [the previous post](https://open-ebike.github.io/devlog/2025/09/24/display-field-data.html) we displayed field data associated with a component.
Now let's [load the service book](https://github.com/open-ebike/open-ebike-frontend/issues/11) associated with an eBike. To do so we need to

* [add a digital service book service](https://github.com/open-ebike/open-ebike-frontend/commit/096fc6c34904da16fcf19b1a9a8ae5bcf94c941c) to fetch the service book associated with an eBike
* [display the service book](https://github.com/open-ebike/open-ebike-frontend/commit/be555b0df49e23d3a1dcae2e91a762baa13797ca) on the eBike details page
